T. Datta, K. Lin - DS 3500

# Description
For this assignment, a Plotly interactive dashboard visualization was created from a CSV containing data on athletic clothing from different brands. It utilized SQL so that the dashboard could interact with a database. In Python, API functions were created to interact with the back end. This dashboard utilized plotly dash and created a box plot of clothing prices based on a user's chosen material and clothing category they want to observe from dropdowns, and a bar chart of prices vs. frequency based on a user's chosen materials they want to observe from a checkbox and size from a slider.
